GRAVITYTOOLS_MOD_DESCRIPTION|Adds gravity manipulation equipment: the Gravity Beacon drone for creating localized gravity wells, and the Gravity Gun for pulling objects towards your ship.
GRAVITYTOOLS_BRIEF|Gravity manipulation equipment

DRONE_GRAV|Gravity Beacon
SYSTEM_GRAVITY_BEACON|Gravity Beacon
SYSTEM_GRAVITY_BEACON_DESC|The Gravity Beacon Drone employs a high-energy mass-effect field generator to artificially manipulate local gravity. It effectively creates a localized gravity well (attraction) or a repulsive shear (repulsion) within a 200 meter radius.\n\nPrimary use cases include debris clearing and mineral gathering.\n\nNote: Operations are limited to 60 seconds per cycle.
SYSTEM_GRAVITY_BEACON_SPEC|Dry Mass: 8,000 kg\nPropellant: 8,000 kg\nAutonomy Class: C1\nCradle Mass: 500 kg\nField Radius: 200m\nMax Field Strength: 5.2G (Propagative)\nField Duration: 60s \nManufacturer: Triskelion-Armstrong
SYSTEM_GRAVITY_BEACON_MANUAL|Deploy the drone to a target location. Use the comms interface to switch between Attraction and Repulsion modes. The drone will automatically station-keep while active. Use the 'Return' command to recover the unit. WARNING: Do not operate near fragile structures.

DIALOG_GRAVITY_READY_1|Gravity manipulation matrix initialized. Standing by.
DIALOG_GRAVITY_READY_2|Drone online. Mass-effect fields stable.
DIALOG_GRAVITY_READY_3|Ready to distort local spacetime on your mark.
DIALOG_GRAVITY_GREETING_1|Systems nominal. Awaiting command.
DIALOG_GRAVITY_GREETING_2|Standing by for instructions.
DIALOG_GRAVITY_GREETING_3|What are your orders?
DIALOG_GRAVITY_ORDER_ATTRACT|Activate Attraction Field
DIALOG_GRAVITY_ORDER_REPEL|Activate Repulsion Field
DIALOG_GRAVITY_CLOSE|Close Channel
DIALOG_GRAVITY_ORDER_OFF|Deactivate Field
DIALOG_GRAVITY_ORDER_RETURN|Return to cradle
DIALOG_GRAVITY_RESPONSE_OK_1|Compliance. Emitters engaged.
DIALOG_GRAVITY_RESPONSE_OK_2|Affirmative. Field active.
DIALOG_GRAVITY_RESPONSE_OK_3|Executing. Gravity well established.
DIALOG_GRAVITY_RESPONSE_OFF_1|Field deactivated.
DIALOG_GRAVITY_RESPONSE_OFF_2|Emitters spinning down.
DIALOG_GRAVITY_TIMEOUT|Energy capacitors depleted. Gravity field offline. Recharging.
DIALOG_GRAVITY_RESPONSE_RETURN_1|Affirmative. Returning to cradle.
DIALOG_GRAVITY_RESPONSE_RETURN_2|Compliance. Engines engaged. Returning.


SYSTEM_GRAVITY_GUN|Gravity Gun
SYSTEM_GRAVITY_GUN_DESC|A high-stress directional gravity emitter. Creates a powerful attractive field cone to pull objects towards the ship.\n\nWARNING: High energy consumption. Use with caution.
SYSTEM_GRAVITY_GUN_SPEC|Force: 1G Point\nEnergy Draw: 500MW\nField Length: 95m\n Mass: 26,000 kg\nManufacturer: Unknown
SYSTEM_GRAVITY_GUN_MANUAL|Hold trigger to activate the directional gravity field. Objects within the cone will be pulled towards the emitter. Ensure sufficient power generation before sustained use.

DAMAGE_GRAVGUN_WEAR|Wear
DAMAGE_GRAVGUN_WEAR_TOOLTIP|Wear occurs naturally when sustaining the gravity field.\nWorn coils have reduced field strength.
DAMAGE_GRAVGUN_BENT|Misalignment
DAMAGE_GRAVGUN_BENT_TOOLTIP|Caused by impacts near the emitter.\nA misaligned emitter pulls objects at an angle.
DAMAGE_GRAVGUN_COIL|Coil Damage
DAMAGE_GRAVGUN_COIL_TOOLTIP|Caused by EMP surges.\nDamaged coils cause the field to flicker and fail randomly.
