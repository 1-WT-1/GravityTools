GRAVITYTOOLS_MOD_DESCRIPTION|Currently adds the Gravity Beacon drone that can create localized gravity wells to attract or repel objects in certain radius.
GRAVITYTOOLS_BRIEF|Gravity manipulation stuff
SYSTEM_GRAVITY_BEACON|Gravity Beacon
SYSTEM_GRAVITY_BEACON_DESC|The Gravity Beacon Drone employs a high-energy mass-effect field generator to artificially manipulate local gravity. It effectively creates a localized gravity well (attraction) or a repulsive shear (repulsion) within a 200 meter radius.\n\nPrimary use cases include debris clearing and mineral gathering.\n\nNote: Operations are limited to 60 seconds per cycle.
SYSTEM_GRAVITY_BEACON_SPEC|Dry Mass: 8,000 kg\nPropellant: 8,000 kg\nAutonomy Class: C1\nCradle Mass: 500 kg\nField Radius: 200m\nMax Field Strength: 5.2G (Propagative)\nField Duration: 60s \nManufacturer: Triskelion-Armstrong
SYSTEM_GRAVITY_BEACON_MANUAL|Deploy the drone to a target location. Use the comms interface to switch between Attraction and Repulsion modes. The drone will automatically station-keep while active. Use the 'Return' command to recover the unit. WARNING: Do not operate near fragile structures.
